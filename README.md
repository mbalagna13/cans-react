## Hello!
Instead of using the create-react-app Starter, I just used this React Boiler Plate that I am more familiar with!

## Info
When loading this app, the app will instantly call the api at specific end point and will then use the data to populate the table! React Table is pretty sweet and will allow you to sort the cans in a plethora of ways: can name, Serial Number, created date, modified date, and most importantly by size! Though the sizes are all the same!
